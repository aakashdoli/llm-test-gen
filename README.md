# 🤖 Universal AI Test Generator

**A smart, automated unit test generator powered by Google Gemini.** Upload any Python project (ZIP), and this tool will auto-detect dependencies, fix import errors, and generate comprehensive `pytest` cases using LLMs.

---

## 🌟 Key Features

* **Universal Project Support:** Upload any Python project structure. The tool automatically sanitizes folder names (e.g., converting `my-project` to `my_project`) to prevent Python `ImportError`.
* **Auto-Dependency Installation:** Automatically detects `requirements.txt` or `setup.py` in the uploaded project and installs missing libraries (`nltk`, `numpy`, `pandas`, etc.) so tests can run immediately.
* **LLM-Powered Generation:** Uses **Google Gemini Pro** to analyze source code and generate intelligent test cases based on your custom requirements.
* **Smart "Fix & Re-run" Workflow:**
    * Tests generated by AI aren't always perfect (e.g., placeholder inputs).
    * **Feature:** Edit the generated test files manually in VS Code, then use the **"🧪 Run Existing Tests Only"** button to verify fixes *without* overwriting your work.
* **Isolated Workspace:** Runs every project in a fresh `temp_workspace` to ensure no file conflicts.

## 🚀 Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/ai-test-generator.git](https://github.com/yourusername/ai-test-generator.git)
cd ai-test-generator
2. Set up a Virtual Environment
It is recommended to use a virtual environment to keep dependencies clean.

Bash

# Mac/Linux
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Windows
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install Dependencies
Bash

pip install streamlit google-generativeai pytest
🛠️ How to Use
1. Start the Application
Run the Streamlit interface:

Bash

streamlit run app.py
2. Configure API Key
Enter your Google Gemini API Key in the sidebar settings.

3. Upload Project
Compress your Python project into a .zip file.

Drag and drop it into the upload area.

4. Generate Tests
Describe your testing requirements (e.g., "Check for edge cases in the calculation function").

Click "🚀 Generate & Run Tests".

The tool will:

Extract and sanitize the project.

Install dependencies found in requirements.txt or setup.py.

Generate test_*.py files in temp_workspace/tests_gen.

Run pytest automatically.

5. The "Fix & Verify" Workflow (Important!)
If the AI generates tests with placeholder values (e.g., passing 0 to a function expecting a string):

Do NOT click "Generate" again (this will overwrite your files).

Open the test file in your editor (e.g., temp_workspace/tests_gen/test_app.py).

Manually fix the inputs or logic.

Go back to the browser and scroll to the bottom.

Click "🧪 Run Existing Tests Only".

This runs your fixed code and shows the green success message! ✅

📂 Project Structure
When the tool runs, it creates a temporary workspace to handle the uploaded code:
